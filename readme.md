# Little Lemon Restaurant - Capstone Project

The purpose of this project is to help Little Lemon manage their database by adding sales reports and creating a table booking system using mySQL.
Little Lemon needs to build a robust relational database system in MySQL in which they can store large amounts of data. 
They then need to easily manage and find this data as required. This database system should maintain information about the following aspects of the business:  

<br/>

* Bookings - To store information about booked tables in the restaurant including booking id, date and table number.
* Orders - To store information about booked tables in the restaurant including booking id, date and table number.
* Order delivery status - To store information about the delivery status of each order such as delivery date and status.
* Menu - To store information about cuisines, starters, courses, drinks and desserts.
* Customer details - To store information about the customer names and contact details.
* Staff information - Including role and salary.
